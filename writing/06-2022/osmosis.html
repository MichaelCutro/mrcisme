            <h2>Osmosis</h2> 
            <p>06.06.2022</p>
            <p><b>Overview</b></p>
            <p>Osmosis is an interchain decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ecosystem. The native token of the Osmosis blockchain, OSMO, is used to secure the Osmosis blockchain (a proof of stake tendermint-based chain) and pay transaction fees. IOW, Osmosis utilizes inter-blockchain communication (IBC) to enable cross-chain transactions. 
            <li>Osmosis‚Äôs role is to be a relayer across app chains - an exchange layer on top of all of the Cosmos chains and the ecosystems that Cosmos connects to</li>   
            <li>The longer-term goal is to bring Osmosis‚Äôs user experience closer to what people are used to with EVM chains without sacrificing the benefits of Tendermint based consensus</li></p> 

            <p><b>Pros and Cons of Application Specific Blockchains</b></p>
            <li>The primary pro is an expanded feature set (access down the full stack through unlocking the application out of the application layer), paying transaction fees in any token, and superfluid staking - which allows you to stake more than just the protocol token to secure the chain but also the equivalence to it; i.e. if you have an LP token that represents a position in ATOM/OSMO pool - you are able to stake that for its OSMO equivalent.</li>
            <li>The main con is you lose the ability to do atomic transactions across applications. Even though you can do cross-chain transfers using IBC, you can‚Äôt do them at the same time. Users can‚Äôt send one transaction from one chain to another, and then a different transaction back in one go as you can with Ethereum</li>

            <p><b>Osmosis Growth</b></p>
            <li>In lieu of general-purpose blockchains, a multichain future of application-specific blockchains as a potential destination needs a natural hub which is a dex</li> 
            <li>Therefore, a key driver in adoption of Osmosis is in parallel with the growth of chains that have built on the Cosmos SDK</li> 
            <li>Contrary to other projects in the crypto space - there was no VC seed round for Osmosis as the aim is to be community-led and governed</li> 

            <p><b>Osmosis Business Model</b></p>
            <li>Osmosis revenue is generated mainly via swaps through the dex; the fee is 0.3% - the value accrual is entirely to the liquidity providers</li> 
            <li>There may be a split down the road on liquidity providers and through sending to validators (delegators to validators)</li>
            <li>There is no concept of a team fund; all protocol revenues go to the protocol, which is defined as the community and key stakeholders</li>  
            <li>The second type of protocol revenue is transaction fees. In the first year of operation, Osmosis subsidized tx fees, but as the Osmosis application set expands, there will be more value captured by transaction fees than swap fees on a single dex</li> 
            <li>Transactions fees on Osmosis accrue to stakers / users who delegate to validators</li>
            <li>In summary, the 0.3% swap fee goes to liquidity providers which is defined as supply side revenue and in the near future transaction fees will be added as protocol revenue</li> 

            <p><b>Purpose of Token</b></p>
            <li>The OSMO token is used to secure the Osmosis blockchain and pay transaction fees (which is standard across all Cosmos based chains)</li> 
            <li>The OSMO token also has a unique governance related power which is the power to direct liquidity, i.e. token holders can direct OSMO incentives</li>
            <li>For instance, if you are an OSMO token holder you can vote on where incentives go and how they are adjusted on a weekly basis</li>
            <li>Governance participation is very active in the Osmosis ecosystem. There is a B2B side of governance for instance, a proposal to give a loan to a chain so they can launch a token and bootstrap their liquidity</li>

            <p><b>Upcoming Developments</b></p>
            <li>The first live use case for an app chain was superfluid staking which cannot be done in Ethereum‚Äôs current form</li> 
            <li>A cross chain native stable swap will be launched on Osmosis and alongside this will be the bridge launch with Ethereum (currently being tested on Frontier)</li>
            <li>Support for Ethereum signing on Osmosis which will *hopefully* make Osmosis the first non-evm chain that you can add as a metamask rpc</li>
            <li>The offerings of centralized exchanges are broader than just simple swaps, the ideal goal is that Osmosis will capture most or all of those features natively on the Osmosis chain</li>
            <li>The medium term roadmap in accordance with stable swaps would potentially be a lending / synthetic assets platform that will allow Osmosis to coexist with other types of applications that need to be on the same chain with one another</li> 

            <p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
            <li>A portion of swap fees down the road could go to token holders (governance would dictate this), albeit this is not necessarily relevant or likely due to the nature of the community treasury growing steadily over time because of the 5% take of all OSMO inflation</li> 
            <li>OSMO inflation decreases every year ‚Äúthe third inning‚Äù where OSMO will eventually cap at 1 Billion supply</li>
